/**
 * Represents a ranking entry with a player's name, points, and seconds.

 * This class is used to store and retrieve ranking information.
 * Each ranking entry includes the player's name, points earned, and seconds taken.

 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * Ranking ranking = new Ranking("John", 100, 30);
 * int points = ranking.getPoints();
 * String name = ranking.getName();
 * int seconds = ranking.getSeconds();
 * ```
 *
 * Note: This class assumes that the points and seconds are non-negative integers.
